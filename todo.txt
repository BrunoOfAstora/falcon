								/*TODO*/

-Make the functions more modular, and less retrictive

-Add error handling in all of the funnctions

-Add file shredder

-Add two options for the verify fundtion, one to verify files by comparing only hashes, and other to 
	comapre files by name + hash. The advantage of second option, is that the program will consume less
	process, since program will not have to iterate through all files, but the file name must be the 
	same.

-->W.I.P
	-Make a way to verify automaticaly 
	

-->Done!
	-Make the "save function" create a folder and save in it
